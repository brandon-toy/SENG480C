### Assignment 1: Alternative Inputs or Outputs

The goal of this assignment is to help students rethink how people can provide inputs to computers and
receive outputs from computers in ways that are different from the standard desktop paradigm where in
people use a mouse, keyboards and computer displays.

Here students are required tocreate a provocative system using hardware, software and physical
material store imagine how an existing example of input and output can b echanged. For example,can
someone write software code using an interface that is not desktop-based? Or can a musician create
music without using the standard musical instrument?

Students are expected to understand and apply concepts from tangible user-interface literature to create
such input/output interfaces.

This is an **individual assignment** for both undergraduatesand graduate students.

**Requirements:**
a) The assignment requires you to use:
i) Electronics
ii) Physical materials
iii) Programming
b) Think about the overall design - it should not simply be some electronics on a breadboard or
paper pasted on electronics for the sake of using physical materials
c) The system must be provocative or push our thinking forward. Remember your system design
does not have to be applicable for today, it can be based on a future use scenario. However, the
design must still be meaningful and critically considered.
d) Carefully select the scope of what you want to create. For example, if your vision is to reimagine
how someone can program, you do not have to create an exhaustive SDK for this assignment.
Instead, demonstrating one very specific example such as how someone creates a for-loop is
enough for this assignment. Also, remember the input/output mechanism has to work, so think
about how much time you will need to implement something.
e) You can use any material available on the Internet (e.g., existing software code) but you must
cite the source and not falsely claim it as your own. Do not simply replicate an example from


```
Instructables or elsewhere. You must make at least some changes and articulate the changes
made.
```
**Deliverables:**

```
a) Project Document: must include the following information:
i) What is the aim or purpose of the input/output you created?
ii) What is the motivation for creating the input/output you designed? This should be
explained from an end-user perspective e.g., help people to <do something>
iii) Explain the system in full detail. Write the details at a level that someone else can
replicate the project. For example, explain what materials and tools you used for
creating your project. List the steps someone would need to follow to make the project
work. Use photos to supplement your textual instructions. Provide a link to the software
code and instructions for using the code.
```
```
The textual description must not exceed 2500 words. Images and references are not
included in the word count. You must edit and proofread your document with a view to
brevity and clarity.
```
```
b) Video : submit a 2-3 minute video demonstrating yourprototype. Use voice-over or subtitles to
explain what is happening in the video. The video must include a title that lists the project name,
student name and V number, and must be encoded as MP4. If your TA and I cannot play the
video, you will be asked to reproduce the video.
```
**What and Where to Upload:**

```
a) Project website - Post all of the above-listed informationon your project website
b) Brightspaces - Upload a PDF of the project documentand the MP4 video file.
```
**How to create a project website:**

```
a) Create a project website (https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/what-is-the-oac/). You will
use the website to document your assignments throughout the term.
b) Give the site a descriptive name so we can identify you uniquely. Do not use a generic course
name title
c) Select the “E-portfolio” option for creating your website
d) Set Privacy to: Visible only to registered users of this network
e) Add your team members and your TA to the website as administrators.
f) If you have questions, contact for help:https://www.uvic.ca/systems/services/contact/index.php
```

**Class Show-and-Tell:**

```
a) Prepare for amaximum 3-minuteshow-and-tell for yourassignment. Thiswill be a live demobut
keep the video as a backup in case the demo does not work. Also, prepare to answer 1-
questions from the class and discuss your project. Every student is expected to participate in the
Q&A.
b) To ensure the demo session goes off smoothly, you must come to class on time and set up
everything you need for your demo.
